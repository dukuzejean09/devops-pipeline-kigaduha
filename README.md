## 🎯 Overview

DevOps Pipeline Kigaduha is a comprehensive DevOps implementation project that demonstrates best practices for continuous integration, continuous deployment, infrastructure management, and automated project workflows. This repository serves as a template and learning resource for building robust DevOps pipelines.

### Key Objectives

- Implement automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Establish infrastructure as code practices
- Automate project management with GitHub Projects
- Enforce security best practices
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Foster collaborative development

---

## ✨ Features

### Automated Project Management

- **Issue Automation**: New issues automatically added to project board (Backlog status)

- **PR Tracking**: Pull requests automatically move to "In Review"
- **Completion Tracking**: Merged PRs move to "Done"

### Security & Quality

- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Dependabot for dependency updates
- Secret detection and scanning
- Code linting and formatting

### Developer Experience

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Git**: Version control system
- **Pre-commit**: For running pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
- **Python**: Required for some pre-commit hooks (Python 3.8+)
- **Node.js**: Required if working with JavaScript/TypeScript (Node 16+)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dukuzejean09/devops-pipeline-kigaduha.git
   cd devops-pipeline-kigaduha
   ```

2. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (recommended):

   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit
   pip install pre-commit

   # Install the git hooks
   pre-commit install
   pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
   ```

3. **Run pre-commit on all files** (optional):

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

### Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
4. **Commit with conventional commits**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**

---

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code (protected)
- `feature/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `docs/*`: Documentation updates
- `chore/*`: Maintenance tasks

### Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`

**Example**:
```
feat(ci): add automated testing workflow

Implement GitHub Actions workflow for running tests on pull requests.
Includes unit tests, integration tests, and code coverage reporting.

Closes #42
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run checks before each commit:

- Trailing whitespace removal
- YAML/JSON syntax validation
- Large file detection
- Private key detection
- Markdown linting
- Shell script linting
- Secret detection

To bypass hooks (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Project Automation Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/project-automation.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Issue opened → Adds to project board (Backlog)
- Issue assigned → Moves to In Progress
- PR opened → Moves to In Review
- PR merged → Moves to Done

**Required Secret**: `PROJECTS_PAT` (GitHub Personal Access Token with project permissions)

### Setting Up CI/CD

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Create token with `project` and `repo` scopes
   - Add as repository secret named `PROJECTS_PAT`

2. **Configure Project URL**:
   - Update project URL in `.github/workflows/project-automation.yml`
   - Default: `https://github.com/users/dukuzejean09/projects/2`

## 📊 Project Board Automation

Our project board follows this workflow:

```
Backlog → In Progress → In Review → Done
```

### Status Transitions

| Event | From | To |
|-------|------|-----|
| Issue opened | - | Backlog |
| Issue assigned | Backlog | In Progress |
| PR opened (linked) | In Progress | In Review |
| PR merged | In Review | Done |

### Using the Project Board

1. **Create an issue** using the appropriate template
2. **Assign yourself** when you start work (auto-moves to In Progress)
3. **Create a PR** and link it to the issue (auto-moves to In Review)
4. **Merge the PR** after approval (auto-moves to Done)

---

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Quick Contribution Steps

1. Check existing issues or create a new one
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a feature branch
4. Make your changes
5. Write/update tests
6. Update documentation
7. Submit a pull request

### Issue Templates

- **Bug Report**: Report bugs or unexpected behavior
- **Feature Request**: Suggest new features or enhancements
- **DevOps Task**: Infrastructure, CI/CD, or configuration tasks

---

## 🛡️ Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

### Required for Merging

- ✅ Pull request reviews (at least 1 approval)
- ✅ Status checks must pass
- ✅ Branch must be up to date
- ✅ No direct pushes (use pull requests)

### Best Practices

- Create feature branches for all changes
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write descriptive PR descriptions
- Link PRs to related issues
- Respond to review feedback promptly
